# Time_Series_Forecasting_Project

This project focuses on financial time series analysis involving stock price forecasting, volatility estimation, and pairs trading strategy development. 
It includes loading and exploring financial data, applying stationarity tests, implementing classical econometric models (ARIMA, GARCH, Cointegration), developing a pairs trading strategy, and building machine learning models (LSTM, Prophet) for forecasting. Finally, compare the models and visualize the results in an interactive dashboard to summarize findings and insights.
